# MAJOR_PROJECT_Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation

# project-1-Cardovascular-Disease-prediction-using-Mavhine-Learning

*In this Major project The main objective is to use the unsupervised learning algorithm to find the best  score..

*The given data contains missing values and categorical data, we have to preprocess the data and find insights by plotting Graphs.

*To preprocess the data we can apply label encoding or onehot encoding.

* To plot the graphs we can use matplotlib and seaborn.

*Next we have to apply Kmeans clustering algorithm to find the clusters.
*The packages involved are
a)Numpy - Arithmetic operations
b)Matplotlib - To visualize the data
c)pandas - create and manipulate data
c) scikitlearn - predictive data analysis
d)seaborn - to visualize data
* the differnt plots used are scatterplot, lineplot, piechart ,histogram, barchart
* By plotting the playlist genres , playlist names graphs we can find the cluster belonging to different classes.
* we can use correlation matrix to find the correct and incorrect predictions
